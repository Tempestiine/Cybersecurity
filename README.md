# Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Documenting my path from beginner to cybersecurity professional through hands-on challenges.

## Who Am I?

I'm Khai Pham, a Computer Science student at Rice University (Class of 2029) passionate about cybersecurity. This repository showcases my progress in building technical skills and analytical thinking through practical challenges.

## Why Cybersecurity?
I’m drawn to cybersecurity’s blend of problem-solving and real-world impact. Whether it’s analyzing logs to detect intrusions or securing systems, I’m excited to develop skills that protect digital environments.

## Goals
- Develop a strong foundation in Linux, networking, and scripting for cybersecurity roles.  
- Build a portfolio that demonstrates analytical thinking and technical proficiency.  
- Prepare for internships by connecting academic challenges to real-world applications.

## Current Focus: OverTheWire Bandit

Starting with Linux fundamentals because they're the foundation of cybersecurity work:
- Command line navigation and file permissions
- Finding and analyzing files 
- Understanding system behavior
- Building problem-solving methodology

## My Approach
Each challenge writeup addresses:  
- **What I Learned**: Key technical skills and concepts.  
- **Why It Matters**: How the skills apply to cybersecurity (e.g., log analysis, incident response).  
- **How I’ll Use It**: Practical applications for future challenges or real-world tasks.

By documenting mistakes and solutions, I aim to build a systematic, reflective approach to problem-solving.
