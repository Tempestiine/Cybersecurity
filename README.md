# Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Documenting my path from beginner to cybersecurity professional through hands-on challenges and real learning.

---

## Who Am I?

I'm Khai Pham, a CS student who's starting his cybersecurity journey. This repository will document my thought process when tackling problems and issues in the broad field of cybersecurity.

**You'll find:** My approach to challenges, what I learned, and why it matters for real security work.  

## Current Focus: OverTheWire Bandit

Starting with Linux fundamentals because they're the foundation of cybersecurity work:
- Command line navigation and file permissions
- Finding and analyzing files 
- Understanding system behavior
- Building problem-solving methodology

## Current Repository Structure

```
├── OverTheWire: Bandit  # Linux fundamentals through Bandit
└── README.md            # This file
```

*More platforms will be added as I progress.*

## What Makes This Different

Instead of copying solutions, I'll document:
- **Multiple ways** to solve each challenge
- **What went wrong** and how I fixed it
- **Real-world applications** of each technique
- **Connections** between different concepts

## My Approach

Each writeup answers three questions:
1. What did I learn?
2. Why does this matter in cybersecurity?
3. How would I use this technique again?

This helps me build lasting knowledge instead of just completing challenges.

## Goal

Build the analytical thinking and systematic approach that cybersecurity work requires. This repository tracks that development from day one.
