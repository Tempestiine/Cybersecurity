## My Experience

### Initial Approach/Struggles

Beforehand, I was actually struggling with submitting a password to access this level. To save their resources, Bandit will not allow me to use `ssh` from the bandit0 account to connect to bandit1. Bandit told me to log out. I made a text file to contain my passwords to the bandit accounts and pasted the bandit1 password inside Kali Linux. When I pressed `ctrl` and `D`, I logged out of bandit0 and stayed in the terminal.

At first, I thought no files existed. However, looking at Bandit, I deduced that there's a file literally named `-`, so I tried reading it.
