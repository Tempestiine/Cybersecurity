# [Bandit Level 1 â†’ Level 2](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html)

## Challenge Description
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `-` located in the home directory.

Commands you may need to solve this level:
`ls` `cd` `cat` `file` `du` `find`

## My Experience

### Initial Approach/Struggles
Beforehand, I was actually struggling with submitting a password to access this level. To save their resources, Bandit will not allow me to use `ssh` from the bandit0 account to connect to bandit1. Bandit told me to log out. I made a text file to contain my passwords for the bandit accounts and pasted the bandit1 password inside Kali Linux. When I pressed `Ctrl + D`, I logged out of bandit0 and stayed in the terminal.

At first, I thought no files existed. However, looking at the Bandit challenge, I deduced that there's a file literally named `-`, so I tried reading it.

### Solution Process

**Step 1: Attempt to read the file**
```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ ls
-
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat -
^C
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat "-"
^C
```
- `ls` reveals the contents of a directory
- `cat` reads text from a file directly in terminal
- `^C` is a signal to terminal to terminate a process. Likewise, in Java and Python, `break` terminates a process. This is created by pressing both `Ctrl + C` (not `Ctrl + D`)
- I used `^C` because I think there was something wrong with Terminal. I was stuck using the command, and Terminal seemed to have paused itself.
- Result: I did a Google search on how to read "dashed filenames"

**Step 2: Try again with correct syntax**
```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
```
- According to [Shotts](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0020.php), "the `.` notation refers to the working directory itself", and when running most commands, "./" is implied at the beginning
- Basically, the `.` tells Terminal to look at the directory we are currently located in, which is supposed to seem arbitrary but has an important use. Likewise, in Java programming, some constructors implicitly call `super()` first while instance variables and called instance methods within instance methods have `this.` implicitly added at the beginning
- I ran the command above and obtained the password to the next level

## What I Learned

### New Commands/Concepts
1. I have to modify the `cat` command when trying to read files with special characters
2. Some commands implicitly add `./` at the beginning, but when dealing with special characters, I need to be explicit
3. The `-` character has special meaning in Linux (represents stdin/stdout), so it can't be used directly as a filename in commands

## Real-World Applications
- **Security assessment**: Attackers might try to hide malicious files using special characters, thinking they're harder to access
- **System administration**: Understanding how to handle files with unusual names is crucial when cleaning up systems or investigating suspicious activity
- **File forensics**: During incident response, you might encounter files with special characters that require specific techniques to examine

## Key Takeaway
Naming a file with special characters does not protect against hackers accessing private content. In fact, understanding how to handle these edge cases is an essential skill for cybersecurity professionals. This level taught me that the command line has specific rules for handling special characters, and learning these rules makes me more capable of navigating any system I encounter.
