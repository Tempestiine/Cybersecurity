# [Bandit Level 5 â†’ Level 6](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit6.html)

## Challenge Description
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the 
has the following properties:

          human-readable
          1033 bytes in size
          not executable

Commands you may need to solve this level:

`ls` `cd` `cat` `file` `du` `find`

## My Experience

### Initial Approach/Struggles
There are twenty directories in the `inhere` directoy, each packed with misleading files and content. However, one file holds the password. I had a gut feeling that the `find` command will prove useful

### Solution Process

**Step 1: Navigate to the `inhere` directory and find the right file**
```bash
bandit4@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -la
total 88
drwxr-x--- 22 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root    4096 Jul 28 19:03 ..
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere00
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere01
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere02
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere03
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere04
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere05
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere06
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere07
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere08
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere09
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere10
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere11
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere12
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere13
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere14
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere15
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere16
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere17
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere18
drwxr-x---  2 root bandit5 4096 Jul 28 19:03 maybehere19
```

Being curious, I wanted to see what I would find if I looked in the first directory.

```bash
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cd maybehere00
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere/maybehere00$ ls
-file1  -file2  -file3  spaces file1  spaces file2  spaces file3
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere/maybehere00$ cat ./file1
cat: ./file1: No such file or directory
```

Brute force does not look like the best and effective solution. I need to use `file`.

```bash
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find * -readable
maybehere00
maybehere00/-file2
maybehere00/.file3
maybehere00/-file1
maybehere00/-file3
maybehere00/spaces file2
[dozens of more files listed]
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find * -readable -size 1033c
maybehere07/.file2
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cd maybehere07
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere/maybehere07$ cat ./.file2
[password displayed]
```

- `find` searches through the current working directory and subdirectories for files.
- `-readable` is a flag that modifies the `find` command to look for human-readable files.
- Because there were a bunch of readable files, I needed to add more specifications and parameters.
- `-size` is a flag (?) that customizes `find` to look for files with specific byte sizes. Above, I requested for files with a size of 1033 bytes. [PS ADD MORE information about how the size flag or option or something is uniquely displayed]


## What I Learned

### New Commands/Concepts
1. **File type identification**: The `find` command allows users to obtain desired files efficiently.

## Real-World Applications
? What I imagine it could be.

On computers, there are hundreds of files, and being able to be selective and pick the one you want is very critical.
If you're a hacker, you would scope for files with sensitive information. Or, if you're a cybersecurity specialist, you would try to protect those files and eliminate vulnerabilities.
If you're troubleshooting something, you would want to look at files containing data and configuration.
When gathering evidence, you would only want to look for necssary files.


## Key Takeaway
Learning to work efficiently with multiple files using the `file` command also saves significant time when dealing with large datasets.
