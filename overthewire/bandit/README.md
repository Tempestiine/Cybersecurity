## Learning Goals

- Master Linux command line navigation
- Understand file permissions and system security
- Build systematic problem-solving approach
- Connect basic techniques to real cybersecurity work

## Progress

- Individual level writeups will document my approach, what I learned, and how each technique applies to cybersecurity.
- However, the structure of each writeup will change slightly and adapt to the problem thrown by Bandit. Though, I'll ensure each writeup is completely readable and understandable.
