## Why Bandit?

I chose Bandit first because I really want to build a strong foundation in cybersecurity. When I was first introduced to cybersecurity, it was the first thing I touched. Frankly, I have restarted and went through Bandit two times in the past. Third time's a charm.

## Progress

Each levelâ€™s writeup will document my approach, lessons learned, and real-world applications. The structure will adapt to each challenge while remaining clear and readable.
